### Data Source & Cleaning

**Source:** [Myntra Fashion Product Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hiteshsuthar101/myntra-fashion-product-dataset/data) with 11 columns: index, p_id, name, price, color, brand, img, ratingCount, avg_rating, description, p_attributes.

**Cleaning Process (Excel):**

- **Removed Irrelevant Columns:** Deleted non-analytical fields (index, images, descriptions, p_attributes, unnamed row numbers) to focus on core data (p_id, name, price, colour, brand, ratingCount, avg_rating).

- **Handled Blank Rows:** Used copy-paste values to a new sheet to eliminate empty rows, ensuring only populated records remained.

- **Filtered Incomplete Records:** Applied filters to remove rows with blank ratingCount, resulting in a high-quality dataset of 355 rated products for reliable analysis.

### Tools Used

**Excel:** Initial exploration and cleaning.

**MySQL:** Database storage (CREATE TABLE with data types like DECIMAL for price/avg_rating, VARCHAR for brand/colour) and querying.

**Power BI:** Interactive visualization (5 pages with KPIs, donut chart, bar charts, scatter plots, matrix; synced slicers for brand and colour).

### Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Feature Ahika more in recommendations**

Ahika has the most reviews (58,569) with a good 4.10 average rating - showing it more can increase clicks and sales.

- **Prioritize Black and Pink colors** 

Black (48,410 reviews, 4.18 rating) and Pink (44,057 reviews, 4.15 rating) are the top performers - recommend giving them more space in the recommendations sections for better engagement.

- **Promote high-rated premium & niche brands** 

Brands like Divena, Fashion Depth, and Ojjasvi have excellent ratings (>=4.5) at prices >1500 but low reviews - suggest featuring them in luxury or “Top Rated” sections to attract high-value customers and build trust.

- **Improve quality in high-volume brands** 

Ahika leads reviews, but only 7.1% products are >=4.5 stars - opportunity to upgrade popular products and boost overall recommendation quality.

**Purpose:** Measures total customer engagement through review volume.

- **High-Rated Product% =** 

                             DIVIDE ( COUNTROWS ( FILTER ( myntra_cleaned_dataset, myntra_cleaned_dataset[avg_rating]>=4.5 ) ),

                             COUNTROWS ( myntra_cleaned_dataset ), 0 )

**Purpose:** Identifies the proportion of products rated 4.5 stars and above.

- **Avg Price for High Ratings =**

                                 CALCULATE ( AVERAGE ( myntra_cleaned_dataset[price] ), myntra_cleaned_dataset[avg_rating]>=4.5 )

**Purpose:** Shows the average price point of well-rated products.

- **Top Brand Rating Share =**

                             VAR Top3Brands =
